# WorkHub

## Introduction
Flexible working arrangements have become popular among employers and self-employment has also been on the rise. This has led to the continued rise of the ‘gig economy’, providing benefits to both employers and workers. The aim of this project is to build a platform that will benefit students and residents or SME from the university (ies) surrounding. Residents or SME will be able to advertise small jobs such “cleaning before a party” or “replacing a waitress” and the students will be able to choose to do these jobs and keep the flexibility needed by their study. In order to prevent malpractice, ratings and reviews will be heavily relied on and will be emphasised in order to promote good behaviour.
